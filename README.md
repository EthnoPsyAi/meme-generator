# Meme Generator

## About the Project
This is a beginner-friendly web project where users can create their own internet memes by inputting a top and bottom text along with an image URL. The meme gets displayed instantly on the page, and users can delete them individually.

## Features
- Add top and bottom text to any image
- Instant preview of the meme
- Clean and simple form interface
- Delete button for removing individual memes

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS) for interactivity and DOM manipulation

## How to Run
1. Download all three files: `pro3MemeGenerator.html`, `pro3MemeGenerator.css`, and `pro3MemeGenerator.js`
2. Make sure they are all in the same folder
3. Open `pro3MemeGenerator.html` in your web browser
4. Fill out the form with meme text and image URL, then click the button to generate your meme

## Personal Note
This project helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. I especially learned how to handle forms and use `appendChild()` to dynamically add content to a webpage. It was also my first time using `event.preventDefault()` correctly.

## Future Improvements
- Add option to upload local images instead of just URLs
- Allow font size and color customization
- Save memes to local storage
- Add responsive design for mobile
